# Java Console Calculator

This is a simple Java Console Calculator built as part of my learning task.  
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) directly from the console.  

The program uses:
- `Scanner` class for user input
- Separate methods for each operation
- Loops to allow multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit
- Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero

## Features
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/) with divide-by-zero check
- Input validation for numbers

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java
